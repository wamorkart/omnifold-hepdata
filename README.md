# omnifold-hepdata


**Standardized publication of OmniFold models, weights, and per-event unfolded results**

`omnifold-hepdata` is a public-facing, experiment-agnostic framework for publishing, sharing, and reusing OmniFold-based unfolding results. It provides a standardized structure for distributing trained neural networks, per-event OmniFold weights, and derived unfolded observables in a way that is compatible with **HEPData** and supports long-term reproducibility and reinterpretation.
